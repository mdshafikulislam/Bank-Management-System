## ABOUT PROJECT    : 
                    The Bank Management System an application for keeping up
					an individual's record in a bank. In this basic project I attempted
					to show the working of banking system and spread theessential
					usefulness of a Bank Management System. It is an application
					that is used to maintain a customerâ€™s account in bank. The main
					aim of this project is to develop software for
					BankManagementSystem. This project has been developed to
					carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible
					with the manual systems, which are overcome by this software.
					Our Banking Management System will give relief to both the
					customer and employees as well. This system will be used to
					store customer data, their cash and information as well and will
					do transaction upon requesting. It will also keep record of each
					transaction. We can also perform other tasks as well. For
					example; we can add customer, we can update their record,
					delete a customer, withdraw and transact amount and keep a
					record of each transaction.
